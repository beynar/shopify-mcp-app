# Object: `WebhookSubscriptionMetafieldIdentifier`

Webhook subscriptions let you receive instant notifications when important events happen in a merchant's store, so you can automate workflows and keep your systems in sync without constantly polling for updates.

For example, a subscription might monitor `orders/create` events and send JSON payloads to `https://yourapp.com/webhooks/orders` whenever customers place new orders, enabling immediate order processing workflows.

Use the `WebhookSubscription` object to:
- Monitor active webhook configurations
- Access subscription details like topics, endpoints, and filtering rules
- Retrieve creation and update timestamps for audit purposes
- Review API versions and format settings
- Examine metafield namespace configurations for extended data access

Each subscription includes comprehensive configuration details such as the specific Shopify events being monitored, the destination endpoint (HTTP, EventBridge, or Pub/Sub), event filtering criteria, and payload customization settings. The subscription tracks its creation and modification history.

Subscriptions can include advanced features like Shopify search syntax for event filtering to control
which events trigger notifications, specific field inclusion rules to control which fields are included
in the webhook payload, and metafield namespace access to capture custom store data. The API version
is inherited from the app that created the webhook subscription.

The endpoint configuration varies by type - HTTP subscriptions include callback URLs, EventBridge subscriptions reference AWS ARNs, and Pub/Sub subscriptions specify Google Cloud project and topic details. This flexibility allows apps to integrate webhooks with their preferred infrastructure and event processing systems.
